In this lab report, you will implement all Group Choice Options (1-3) from Lab 5.
Complete them for yourself (if you haven’t already), and take the relevant screenshots listed below. 
Create a post with a few sentences of description about all the options available. 

## Streamlining ssh Configuration
* Show your .ssh/config file, and how you edited it (with VScode, another program, etc)
* Show the ssh command logging you into your account using just the alias you chose.
* Show an scp command copying a file to your account using just the alias you chose.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6
* Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in your user account (screenshot).
* Show where the private key you made is stored on your user account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.
* Show running git commands to commit and push a change to Github while logged into your ieng6 account.
* Show a link for the resulting commit.

## Copy whole directories with scp -r
* Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account.
* Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository.
* Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.
